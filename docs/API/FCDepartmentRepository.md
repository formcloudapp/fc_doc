## Overview
`FCDepartmentRepository` is a class that extends `FCRepository` to manage `cmn_department` records in ServiceNow. It provides functionality to retrieve departments and their hierarchical structures.

## Class Methods

### constructor
```javascript
new FCDepartmentRepository(overrideACL)
```
Creates a new instance of the department repository.

**Parameters:**
- `overrideACL` (boolean): When true, bypasses Access Control List restrictions

**Example:**
```javascript
var deptRepo = new FCDepartmentRepository(false);
```

### getByBusinessUnit
```javascript
getByBusinessUnit(businessUnitId, isSerialized)
```
Retrieves all departments associated with a specific business unit.

**Parameters:**
- `businessUnitId` (string): The system ID of the business unit
- `isSerialized` (boolean): When true, returns plain JavaScript objects; when false, returns GlideRecord objects

**Returns:**
- Array of departments (GlideRecord[] or Object[])

**Example:**
```javascript
var deptRepo = new FCDepartmentRepository(false);

// Get departments as GlideRecords
var depts = deptRepo.getByBusinessUnit('business_unit_sys_id', false);

// Get departments as serialized objects
var serializedDepts = deptRepo.getByBusinessUnit('business_unit_sys_id', true);

// Process departments
depts.forEach(function(dept) {
    gs.info('Department: ' + dept.name);
});
```

### getDepartmentTreeForId
```javascript
getDepartmentTreeForId(sysId)
```
Retrieves the hierarchical tree of departments for a given department ID. This method returns all parent departments up to the root department.

**Parameters:**
- `sysId` (string): The system ID of the department

**Returns:**
- Array of departments in hierarchical order (root to leaf)

**Example:**
```javascript
var deptRepo = new FCDepartmentRepository(false);

// Get department hierarchy
var deptTree = deptRepo.getDepartmentTreeForId('department_sys_id');

// Process department tree
deptTree.forEach(function(dept) {
    // Assuming departments have a 'level' field based on code
    var indent = '  '.repeat(dept.code);
    gs.info(indent + 'Department: ' + dept.name);
});
```

## Usage Notes

1. The repository uses the `cmn_department` table in ServiceNow.
2. Department hierarchies are determined using the department's ID and code fields.
3. When `isSerialized` is true, you get plain JavaScript objects that can be easily stringified for API responses.
4. The department tree is returned in ascending order by department code.

## Error Handling
It's recommended to wrap repository calls in try-catch blocks:

```javascript
try {
    var deptRepo = new FCDepartmentRepository(false);
    var departments = deptRepo.getByBusinessUnit('business_unit_sys_id', true);
    // Process departments
} catch (ex) {
    gs.error('Error retrieving departments: ' + ex.message);
}
```

## Dependencies
- Requires the base `FCRepository` class
- Requires access to the `cmn_department` table
- Proper ACL configurations if not using `overrideACL`
